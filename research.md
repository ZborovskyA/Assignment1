This reading talking about how learning goals can guide learners and help with self-regulated learning. It also mentions how writing down ones goals (as I have done) is a more effective way of maintaining self regulated learning and following through with the goals, I agree with this statement because you are more likely to not forget about the goal or change it to something easier, I think of it as "set in stone" once it is written down.
